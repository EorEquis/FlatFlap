## Servo Mounts
	Each servo mount is named "Mount Type NNNmm".
	Type = Type of servo.  Standard, Micro, etc.
	NNNmm = The approximate DIAMETER of the arc the "feet" sit on.  Select or modify 
		(And share if you do!) the mount with the correct servo type and OUTER diameter
		of your scope tube.

## Scope Caps
	The one-piece "Full Scope Cover" comes from the original Thing at 
		https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2307397. It has a diameter of approximately 
		115mm.  It can be resized as needed, but bear in mind that rescaling will
		also rescale the servo mount hole.
	The two-piece, "arm" and "lid" are a simpler design requiring no supports, but 
		they do need to be glued together. It has a diameter of approximately 100mm, 
		and should be considerably easier to resize. Just remember to adjust the 
		width of the slot appropriately.
		
## Enclosures
	Nano Enclosure is a modified version of https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:5238660
		The indent for the USB plug has been made deeper for more secure connections,
		and the lid	tweaked for a slightly better fit.
